                <h1>Welcome to React Webpage</h1>
                <p>This page was built using React and hosted on Vercel.</p>
                <h2>Installation Process</h2>
                <p>
                    React was set up using <code>npx create-react-app</code>. I developed the app
                    locally and then deployed it to Vercel.
                </p>
                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    I faced some deployment challenges, but I solved them by reading the Vercel
                    documentation.
